According to [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/1055482):

  * 25 books
  * 7,494 pages
  * 300 pages per book, average
  * 3.8 average rating

How I rated them:

  *  5 stars: 4
  *  4 stars: 15
  *  3 stars: 4
  *  2 stars: 2

Again with the selection bias, weighted heavily towards 4+ stars. Probably a given since I'm unlikely to finish a 1 or 2 star book and most of my reading list comes from recommendations or known authors.
