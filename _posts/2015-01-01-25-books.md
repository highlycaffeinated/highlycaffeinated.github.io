How I rated them:

  *  2 - 5 stars
  *  10 - 4 stars
  *  10 - 3 stars
  *  2 - 2 stars

Since I consider a score of three to be average, I'd expect the highest count here.  The scant number of ones and twos reflects my impatience to finish a 'bad' book.  A little heavier on the fours than I'd have expected though I suspect this to be a reflection of selection bias - choosing topics / authors / books for which I already have a favorable impression.
