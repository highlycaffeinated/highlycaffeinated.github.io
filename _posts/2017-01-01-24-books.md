My ratings distribution:

  *  2 - 5 stars
  *  13 - 4 stars
  *  9 - 3 stars

Again the 5 stars are fairly rare, but I'm more than a bit surprised to find no 1 or 2 stars and the bulk of the books at 4 stars. Either I'm self-selecting for books I already know I'll like or I'm getting extremely lenient with my ratings. It's also possible that the books that would get the lowest scores from me are abandoned and/or still unfinished on my shelf.
