Embedded below is a map of the Great Divide route [I'll be riding](/infinite-divide) starting in June. This was shared by someone on the [RideWithGPS site](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/6790263). Another great map resource can be found at [Eat Sleep Ride Great Divide](https://www.eatsleepridegreatdivide.com). The mileages don't quite match the [ACA][aca] version but they're close enough to give a good idea of the scale of this challenge.
