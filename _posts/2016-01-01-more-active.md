I was much more active in 2015 than I have been in previous years. Although I didn't get onto the water much (read: at all), I rode quite frequently and walked the dogs regularly. Here are my stats for the year:

* Rides: 95 total for 2,422 miles or 25.5 mi/ride, (-27/-22%, +134/+6%, +6/+35%) 
* Walks: 158 for 410 miles, or 2.6 mi/walk

Since I'm planning to ride the GDMBR this July/August, I expect the ride numbers for this year to be significantly inflated and the walk numbers to diminish.
