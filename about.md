###About Me

I build things.

For over 25 years, I've been building things that people love to use. Great products. Great software. Great teams. In every role, these have been my legacy. I never stop learning or teaching. I am passionate, hard working, and experienced.

###Things I've Done
My team and I created and continue to build and operate the [Rackspace Cloud Big Data Platform](http://www.rackspace.com/big-data), a web-scale, software as a service product providing Hadoop and Spark clusters on demand for customers around the world.  Built on top of the Rackspace Cloud powered by OpenStack, it utilizes both virtual (Xen Server) and OnMetal servers running on thousands of hosts across multiple data centers.

While at Rackspace, I've also contributed code to open source projects, such as this [file system](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8545) for Hadoop, backed by OpenStack's Swift object store.  Merged into the hadoop-common project in 2013, this component is now a part of core Hadoop and is available to all new clusters.

I worked extensively with [Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union](https://www.rbfcu.org/), a top-25 credit union, to help build their internally developed web banking platform used by hundreds of thousands of customers every day.  In addition, I coordinated the work of multiple teams, internal and external, to develop their mobile banking applications for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rbfcu-mobile/id363515015?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Vertifi.DeposZip.P314089681).

Designed and developed a [pulsation analysis software package](http://www.swri.org/4org/d18/mechflu/pulsat/taps.htm) enabling Southwest Research, an applied research and development organization, to offer design analysis services for complex manifold and piping systems.

Managed the IT organization responsible for growing a [property appraisal software suite](http://www.apexwin.com/appraiser/) into a market leader, while expanding it to numerous platforms, including Windows, the web, mobile and embedded.

###Where I've Done Them
#####Senior Software Development Manager, Rackspace — 2012 - Present  
Rackspace provides public cloud, private cloud, and dedicated hosting services to companies of all shapes and sizes. A founding member of OpenStack, Rackspace is a leading contributor in the open-source community.  I am primarily responsible for the development and operations efforts surrounding our Hadoop strategies. While in this role I have:

- Recruited and managed a team of top-tier software developers and systems engineers and lead the effort to build and launch our Hadoop-as-a-service product. In addition to the engineering effort, this involved the coordination of numerous other teams within the organization, such as marketing, sales, support, finance, and other engineering teams.
- Managed the 24x7 operation of our internal Hadoop clusters where we aggregate data from all product lines in support of activities such as analytics, billing, and customer support.  These clusters span six data centers and contain ~1.2PB of data across ~150 nodes.
- Developed a reference architecture for our dedicated Hadoop offerings for use by sales and marketing.
- Contributed an implementation of the Hadoop File System on top of OpenStack Swift which was recently accepted into Hadoop core (HADOOP-8545).

#####Owner / Principal Consultant, dado Technologies — 2005 - Present  
dado Technologies offers expert-level technical consulting services specializing in software architecture and development, software engineering, systems integration, and development processes. Recent engagements include:

- Providing software design and development services to enhance an existing internet banking application.  Changes include the addition of new features, updates to system architecture to simplify future additions, and the evolution of the architecture to improve scalability.  Extensive use of Java EE, WebSphere, DB2, Struts, Spring, and other related technologies.
- Re-engineering software development processes to include automated build and deployment, automated unit and regression testing, and software quality metrics resulting in a significant decrease in software defects. A number of products were integrated to accomplish this goal, including IBM Rational ClearCase, Hudson/Jenkins, Ant, JIRA, Confluence, jUnit, PMD, FitNesse, and Selenium.
- Developing a one-dimensional time-domain flow solver for pulsation analysis and transient fluid modeling.  This desktop-based application was developed using C# and integrated a number of third-party packages, including DPlot and StimulReports.  The application is deployed to end-users through the ClickOnce deployment model. 
- Designing a kernel-level SATA protocol testing harness for a leading solid-state device manufacturer allowing rigorous adherence to quality control standards and reliable calculation of device mean time between failure statistics. SATA messaging was implemented using a C language extension to the Python language.  Test harness and scripting capabilities were developed using Python.

#####Chief Information Officer, Apex Software, San Antonio, TX — 2005 - 2007  
Apex is the leading vendor of sketching software to the real estate appraisal and assessment markets.  At the time of my arrival Apex was struggling with growth – specifically the expansion of their product line to new markets and to new platforms as well as managing the associated staffing increases to support the growth.  Quality issues and delayed releases were beginning to generate discontent in the customer and VAR communities.  I was tasked with turning this around.  My accomplishments include:
