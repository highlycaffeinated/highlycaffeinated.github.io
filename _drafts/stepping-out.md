title: Stepping out
---

Today I said goodbye, temporarily, to the comfort, the routine, the familiarity of the family, the friends, the job and set forth on an adventure. I can't wait to see where this road leads.

Today I stepped out of the routine of my job; out of the familiarity of my home; out of the comfort of my family and friends. I stepped out to take on a challenge, one asily measured in miles, but ultimately measured in what I learn about myself.
