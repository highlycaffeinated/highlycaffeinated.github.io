title: Day 8 - Elkford Municipal Campground, Rest Day
---

Slept rather late (7!), went back to the showers (because I could) and washed out the rest of my clothes. Met Steven from the airport in the bathroom and chat for a sec. He asks about our campsite so he can come say bye on his way out.

Back to the tents, hang laundry to dry, no sign of Steven so off to the restaurant for breakfast. Doesn't open until 9 so we wait around when Steven rolls up. We all have breakfast together and talk for some time and he finally gets on the road about 10:30. Fantastic guy, hope to cross paths again some day, maybe if I'm ever in Adelaide.

Spend a bit fixing up the bikes, tightening screws, adjusting brakes, lubing and cleaning. Hot out when in the sun, mosquitoes when in the shade so we go back to Sneaky's Pub to nurse a beer and use their free wifi (quite decent, actually). 

The place starts filling up with the regulars, mostly people from the local coal mines so we head back to the camp to nap. I can't sleep so I hang out at the office to charge up the rest of my devices. Get some frustrating news which puts me in a funk for most of the rest of the afternoon. 

Hop over to the market to grab a couple of things - we shouldn't need much because tomorrow's ride is mostly pavement and goes through a couple of towns.

Noodles for dinner, then this journal, bed time soon.
