title: Day 1 - calgary to ghost lake
---

Up early (5:30), excitement? Anticipation ? Time change?

Shower, too long to pack, fantastic breakfast spread (yogurt (by the tub!), oatmeal, bacon eggs toast coffee). Loaded up, pumped up, got directions (and dissent) from Richard and Mavis, then bid them farewell.  

Roll to Canadian Tire, met a stranger that wanted to chat on our way in. Bear mace. Paperwork, forms! To buy it. clerk: if you need this its already too late. Back outside, met kelvin, biker, hiker, chatted us up. Hit the road, hopped moon the 1a, busy, loud, but very clean and free of debris. And the drivers are courteous and aware!

Taking our time because we have it. It's a short, lower-effort day. Stop in Cochran for lunch. Very cute little town. Subway, bleh. Unfailingly the people here are polite, patient, laid back and in no hurries.

Roll on to campground at ghost lake. Lake itself is a reservoir on the ghost river. Apparently glacier melt because lots of white silt. Camp in the provincial campground on a pretty nice site.gets hot when the in is high overhead but cools quickly as the snub disappears behind clouds and eventually behind the nearby ridge. 

Allergies acting up a bit but the smell of the wildflowers fills the air.

Feelings ok so far. Some leg fatigue but not major. Sleepy more than anything. Starting slow was a good idea. 

Noodles for dinner, sans olive oil since it doesn't come in small, or plastic, bottles.Tomorrow the goal is Canmore with a a warm showers host awaiting our arrival.

Dad hurt back, offered gun for the crazy people.

Packing rhythm getting better but still discombobulated. Looking forward to being away from the traffic. Will definitely miss the conveniences (and pavement) of road touring.
