What's the perfect reward for a long, tiring day in the saddle? Why a delicious hand-crafted ale, of course! It's a long ride and I'll certainly be needing refreshments along the way. The question is: where to find them. Where are the micro-breweries along the route? Surely someone has already made a handy list.

I looked around and quite surprisingly found nothing. Nada. Zip. So I began hand-assembling a list of my own. I started with the breweries that are registered with the [Brewers Association][ba]. Next I selected for states along the route. Then I looked up the address of each brewery on a map overlaid with the route. If the brewery was close, I added it to this list. There are bound to be errors and omissions. If you know of (or operate) a brewery not on the list, please [let me know](mailto:david@highlycaffeinated.com) and I'll add it. With any luck I'll stop in and have a pint.

Cheers!
