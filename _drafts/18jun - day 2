title: Day 2 - ghost lake to Canmore
---

Another early morning, chilly, packed up camp, breakfasted and rolled out. (Worst bathrooms ever - pit toilets with 1 gazillion flies that get everywhere (yes, really)).

Start by grinding uphill, then start getting into a rhythm and BAM! Justin has a flat n his back tire. Tear down the wheel, turns out to be a tiny puncture on the inside of the tube where the slime can't seal it. Patch it up, easy enough, remount the wheel and BAM, the tire doesn't seat completely so it doesn't rotate correctly. Get that fix and PFFFFT! The patch blows. Time for a new patch. Lather, rinse, repeat. 1 mile down the road, that patch blows too. Another tear down, this time replacing the tube with a spare. Rolling again, a couple of miles, tire goes soft. Another puncture. Back to the slime tube. Another patch. Patch fails before we get rolling. Patch the non-slime tube. This one seems to hold and off we go. We're 5.5 hrs into our day and only 6 miles down the road. 

Just as we're starting to get a rhythm again, the wind begins. With a vengeance. 30+ mph at times, averaging about 20. Brutal. We keep pushing but exhaustion is creeping up. Running from the rain as the sprinkles tickle us. Oscillate between full sun and complete shadow from the clouds.

Eventually roll into Canmore, stop at Rave Coffee for a latte and contact Paul and Nola, our warm showers hosts. House filled with bikes, mountaineering, and camping gear. Back yard is at the foot of a mountain.

Awesome things: the wild horses that can't figure out what we are, curious and approaching but keep a safe distance; Rocky Mountain sheep, feeding in the crevices in the rock faces; Missy the dog at the convenience store; bow river and all the little lakes; the mountains, oh the beautiful mountains; Saskatoon pie; rave coffee.
