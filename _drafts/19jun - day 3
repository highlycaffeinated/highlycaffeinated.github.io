Slept a little later but sun was out at 5:30 so still too early

Paul made us breakfast, told us mountaineering and logging stories. Interesting guy.

Bike shop for a pump and tubes for Justin. Flatbread company for lunch. Original 16 beeer there was really well done. Pizza was pretty good too. 

Nap time. Then maintenance time on Justin's bike. 

Dinner with Paul and Nola at local family owned place, Patrino's. Lasagna was huge, spicy, pretty good. Conversation was great, night went on. Then to the house and to bed.
