More specifically, I’ll be riding the [Great Divide Mountain Bike Route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divide_Mountain_Bike_Route) from Banff, Canada to the US/Mexico border at Antelope Wells, New Mexico. Along the way I’ll be reading the encyclopedic novel _Infinite Jest_ by David Foster Wallace. Two worthy challenges. Endless potential for adventure.

The wheels have been in motion for over a year to make the ride happen. There were numerous logistical obstacles that had to be overcome - financial, time off from work and away from family, coordinating schedules with other riders, etc. Only recently have those pieces fallen into place.

Although its possible to complete this ride in a few weeks that is not my goal. I’ll be keeping a touring pace, absorbing as much of the experience as possible along the way. However, the timeline is not open-ended. 60 days is about the limit to the generosity of my employer and, most importantly, the patience of my wife.

My good friend [Justin](http://justinlott.com) has accepted the challenge and will be riding with me. We leave on June 16, with a flight to Calgary, then a short ride to Banff where we join up with the trail. Stay tuned!
