- early morning 5:05
- leisurely pack and prep
- cook a first breakfast
- ride to le petit outre, coffee and pastry 
- set out on trail
- dropped sock, backtrack
- long slow grind up rattlesnake trail, backtrack
- find switchback, start 3 hour hike-a-bike
- back bothering me all day, gobbling ibuprofens
- at 1/2 way point, start running out of daylight, make decision to turn back 
- downhill too treacherous to ride
- roll down small sections
- gouge chin
- hit rock, avoid fall but tweak back significantly
- nurse it back, but mashing pedals hurts, climbing back into pedals from stop hurts, soft pedaling and standing on pedals no problem
- stop at grocery, too dazed to pick a beer
- eventually find one, plus damned good huckleberry ice cream
- crash hard pretty much as soon as the sun sets
- 2.5 beers, cook dinner, launder clothes
- dispiriting having to turn back but don't regret getting to see than section of the trail
