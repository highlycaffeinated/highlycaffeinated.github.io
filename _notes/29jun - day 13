title: Day 13 - Columbia Falls - Rest Day
---

Did: coffee shop, backslope brewery (meh), bike maintenance, pannier repair (thanks phil!), laundry, groceries, 

Pretty nice rv park but really squeezed in. Also, closing the only (srsly?) bathrooms from 11-1 for cleaning?

Bye to bill glass (picture of his card), dedicated his rock to him

Thankful for - a day off, my wife, the random kindness of strangers
