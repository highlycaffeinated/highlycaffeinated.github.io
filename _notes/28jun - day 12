title: Day 12 - Tuchuck Campground to Columbia Falls
---

Where am I: Columbia Falls, in the RV park, squeezed into a tent site on gravel

How do I feel: beat. 60+ miles of pushing from the campsite, plus my first puncture, plus no motel 6 (its in kalispell)

What am I thinking? Mentally very low, feeling done, not enjoying. Not sure why because overall the ride was good, just rough. Clearly not getting whatever it is that I need (or want) out of the riding.

How did I get here: 486 gravel road, mixed conditions, quite rattly at times. Lost another pannier screw (srsly?). Polebridge - tiny town - maybe 3 or 4 bldgs. Pretty hopping. Gen mercantile had hit and cold food plus pastries, nice break stop. Met couple at arrival ("taking up all the road") and a woman at departure very interested in our journey.

What now: taking a day off for bike maintenance and recoup

Thankful for: place to pitch my tent, not having to ride to next town, tuchuck is probably the most serenely beautiful campsite I've ever been to.
