title: Day 5 - Spray Lakes West campground to wild camp, Chester lake trailhead
---

25 miles, 10 short of our target. But 25 of the most difficult miles I've ever ridden. Constantly either climbing or descending, with more hike-a-bikes than I care to admit. Spectacular scenery continues with a new "wow" around every corner. The terrain varied from stony to forest to open plain to hilly singletrack to gravel roads, always surrounded by mountains and never far from water, whether greenish blue lakes or crystal clear creeks and rivers. 

Lost my pannier shoulder strap. Guess i forgot to clip it back on at one of our many many stops.

Kleen Kanteen took its first dings when it popped out of the cage (really rough trails) and i ran over it.

Thankful for my redneck fenders. They've worked well so far and kept me dry many many times today.
