title: Day 0 - SAT to YYC
---

5:45 left the familiar to embark on my journey. SAT uneventful. Early to PHX but waited on tarmac for gate to clear. Long layover - Starbucks + lunch at airport restaurant - blech. On to YYC. Waived off on approach - security incident closed airport. Met Stephen White from Adelaide Australia at oversized baggage claim , also riding the GDMBR, will be a day or so ahead of us.
Picked up by Richard King at airport, Met wife Mavis. Dinner at mall. Lots of stories. They've traveled everywhere! Biked everywhere. Very inspiring. 79 years old. Bike assembly smooth. Grocery shopping. Beers (Big Rock Brewery, local). Amazing first day.
