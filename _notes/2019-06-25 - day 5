title: Day 5 - Ovando to Lincoln
---

Where am I:
Sitting in my camp chair next to my tent, my bike, and a gently babbling brook in the lawn of an RV park in Lincoln MT.

What do I see:
The creek. Facing away from the sun because I've already had plenty on my face today.

How do I feel:
Back is on and off problematic. Mentally pretty down. The back worries me quite a bit but the lack of conditioning and my inability to get into the ride itself worries me more.

What am I thinking:
Today's climb was pretty difficult for me. Don't seem to have the ability to just put my head down and turn the cranks anymore. Maybe conditioning, maybe age, maybe all of the above. Need some successes to get into this journey or I'm not going to make it very far.

How did I get here:
38 miles of gravel road in pretty decent condition. 2600+ feet of climbing, 1600 of that in one stretch to get over huckleberry pass.

What now:
Meeting Eric and Sharon (met in Ovando, from Golden, CO, riding roughly our pace atm) for a beer or two to celebrate his birthday.

Sleeping:
In my tent (first time this trip).

Thankful for:
Great weather today. Support from family and friends. A nice park and a warm shower.
