title: Day 9 - Elkford to Fernie
---

Leisurely start
Down 43 (light traffic) to sparwood in a couple of hours. Extended break for lunch at Tim hortons
Jump on 3 south to fernie. Traffic and wind both pick up. Temp is reasonable 79 but the sun is intense. Burned and dehydrated. 
Stop at Fernie BRewing Company for beer but they are closed for renovation. Meet Pauline, he gives us private tour (cool! Big brewery and growing rapidly). he points us to northern bar on 2nd and 6th. 
Good selection at Northern and we sample several and drink 3. Most are very well done. Burger is also, but the tastiest burger so far.
Back to Fernie RV resort. Get a n9ie tent site in the shade but the mosquitos are HORRBILE. Janet helps us in the office, she;s awesonme, helps us get loonies for the laundry.
Little white lie - Alaska!
Easily the nicest rv park so far. Do our laundry, take a hot shower, everything here is new, new, new

Thankful for - good beers, smooth pavement, wide shoulders
