title: Day 4 - Missoula to Ovando
---

Where am I:
Sitting on the porch of the museum in Ovando, MT charging my devices. Cute little town of 81. 

What do I see:
Pretty much all of Ovando. The general store/inn/barbershop/coffee shop etc is directly across the street. The fishing guides are standing around at the end of their shift shooting the shit.

How do I feel:
Better than I thought I would at mile 35. Back still tweaks occasionally, so that's a little alarming. Feel like I can make it to Helena without too much misery. Then it'll be decision time.

What am I thinking:
More confident now, but not actually turning the pedals. Tomorrow's climb to Lincoln will be a test. The following couple of days will be final exam.

How did I get here:
52 miles of pavement on Highway 200 from Missoula. Stopped at the same two Sinclair stations that we stopped at on the way to Missoula from Seeley Lake a couple of years ago.

What now:

Sleeping:
In the Hoosegow (county jail). Built in 1869?. Dark, chilly room with two rope cots a desk, and not much else.

Thankful for:
Great weather today.
