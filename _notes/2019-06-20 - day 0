- nervous morning, not feeling ready 
- breakfast at chess club with halls, jimmy, Mimi
- tape up the box, load things up and head to Austin with all the dogs
- fairly quick goodbye, but harder than I thought. Deep indecision
- check bike - no fee! - clear security, wait with Justin
- already missing home
- plane boards late, somewhat bumpy flight in the absolute last row
- land, get bikes from baggage claim, clear customs, then hustle to get the rental car
- unbox, load up, head to MEC to beat closing in 30 mins
- get bear spray, isobutane, and aeropress (can't believe I forgot THAT)
- decide we need to eat, walk over to Brewster's, sit at bar
- weird drunk dude tries to make conversation and eventually gets cut off
- peanut butter porter and fish and chips - very good
- the rains begin in earnest
- walk across the street to Safeway to get groceries
- back to car and start fretting about weather
- decide to drive to Canmore to try and get past it
- stop at gas station to look at forecast. Not good. Same weather from north of jasper all the way into montana
- sleep in the car to wait it out, will check in morning
