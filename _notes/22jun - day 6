title: Day 6 - Wild camp, Chester lake trailhead to Boulton Trading Post and campground
---

Woke up to Frost on everything and temps in the low 30s. Justin is sicker, my digestive issues have returned and now I'm getting phlegmatic and have a raw throat. Seem to feel ok once I'm on the bike though.

Stop at the William Watson Lodge looking for an indoor bed for the night but no luck as they are a facility for seniors and people with disabilities. Alana at the desk goes way out of her way to help us, though, looking for alternatives on the map and even letting use the phone to call the only one possibly in range. Glad we called because they had no vacancy.So we push on.

Next stop is Boulton Trading Post to shop for groceries and plan. A couple of hot dogs and map session later, we decide that pushing over Elk Pass is probably not going to happen today. Boulton is a pretty nice campground with showers ($2CDN/5min) so we grab a site and some firewood and settle in. Best camp site so far, minus the mosquito swarms. No repellent available since Justin tells me that DEET dissolves nylon (e.g. My sleeping pad, tent, other essentials). 

Learn even more about bears (grizzly sow and cub spotted passing through the area recently). Apparently the wildlife dept tracks them and alerts people/closes areas when they are nearby. Lots of signs seen so far - mostly scat, but today many clawed up trees as well.

The plan is to shoot for Elkford tomorrow. 47 miles but mostly downhill after we cross the pass.

Thankful for: downhills and tail winds.
